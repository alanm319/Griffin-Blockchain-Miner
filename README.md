Griffin Blockchain Miner Project

Description:

Welcome to "Griffin Blockchain Miner", a project that I built in my intermidiate Java and Data Structures class!

Griffin Blockchain Miner consists of a blockchain miner that:

  1. Recieves transactions from the user or a remote node.
  2. Sends these transactions to a remote node.
  3. Manages incoming remote node messages using a Queue.
  4. Generates a Merkle Tree and an eventual Merkle Root as part of transactions processing.
  5. Creates Blockchain Blocks using a Proof of Work algorithm.
  
Griffin Blockchain Miner does not save blocks into a blockchain, but it can be plugged into a larger blockchain application that can fully manage a blockchain and connect to multiple networked nodes.

This project utilizes the following technologies:
  - Socket Programming
  - Queues
  - Multithreading
  - SHA-256 Hashing
  - Merkle Trees
  - Blockchain Proof of Work
